# Overview
There is the need to develop some early understanding about the domain of our problem. This is described on the [Kaggle competition description page here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Here are the highlights to note.
- On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.
- One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.
- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

 ## Model, predict and solve
There are 60+ predictive modelling algorithms to choose from. We must understand the type of problem and solution requirement to narrow down to a select few models which we can evaluate. Our problem is a classification and regression problem. We want to identify relationship between output (Survived or not) with other variables or features (Gender, Age, Port...). We are also perfoming a category of machine learning which is called supervised learning as we are training our model with a given dataset. With these two criteria - Supervised Learning plus Classification and Regression, we can narrow down our choice of models to a few. These include:

- Logistic Regression
- KNN or k-Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Machines
- Naive Bayes classifier
- Decision Tree
- Random Forrest
- Perceptron
- Artificial neural network
- RVM or Relevance Vector Machine
